# Ashcoll Auto Login
## Background
Ashburton College (AshColl) is a school in Ashburton, New Zealand which uses Fortinet to guard its Internet access so students must login to use the restricted internet access.

## How it works

Ashcoll Auto Login first pings the Mozilla captive portal detector - which redirects to the login page of the school. Ashcoll Auto Login then downloads the page - including the session ID which is needed to login. Ashcoll Auto Login then pings the login server with the login request acting as a user clicked the login page except this is all performed automatically.

## How can I get it
Right now Ashcoll Auto Login is still in development - but it will be ready soon!
It will be available via the Play Store or Github via APK with it being added to the apple store if there is enough interest.
