# Ashcoll Auto Login
## Background
Ashburton College (AshColl) is a school in Ashburton, New Zealand which uses Fortinet to guard its Internet access so students must login to use the restricted internet access.

## How it works

Ashcoll Auto Login first pings the Mozilla captive portal detector - which redirects to the login page of the school. Ashcoll Auto Login then downloads the page - including the session ID which is needed to login. Ashcoll Auto Login then pings the login server with the login request acting as a user clicked the login page except this is all performed automatically.
